The awesome people I’ve met and played with and my coach. My exponential growth has also been amazing. Tourney experiences are also the best. 	https://drive.google.com/open?id=15kROCXnzJ3aCIFdXzQsbR4Hr5ZWRHy_v
9/30/2021 20:28:03	Chris	she/her	Junior	Civil and Environmental Engineering	Cooking, Hiking, Working out, Hammocking	I was a camp counselor for 6 years of my life and I loved it. The outdoors is my second home.	I started playing pick up ultimate in high school with friends and loved the sport. I knew I wanted to do it in college and everyone on the team was so friendly I just HAD to be a part of it. 	I’ve never been a part of such an open and positive sport. The Ultimate community is very encouraging and eccentric as can be seen at tournaments and even practice. Not only do I get to be competitive and focus my energy on something other than school, but I also get the benefit building friendships and good vibes with other like minded people.	https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ugHIzb5450cQ3Ls3xPdEuJQxT27tXWx5

At the "throwing on the quad" activity, I talked to Julia, and she mentioned how close the team was and how much she enjoyed it.	I decided to stay with ultimate because I really liked the people I met at practice, and because the sport was reasonably fun. In addition, I really liked the community and how close and supportive members of the team were with one another (and the welcoming attitude towards rookies was made it easier to come back to practice without an excessive amount of anxiety).	https://drive.google.com/open?id=13yvXTH19JyTyuxOA6kmonJvrAehYjFt2
